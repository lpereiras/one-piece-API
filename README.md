# One Piece API 👒🏴‍☠️

## Made by a big fan of the Straw hat crew, besides a curious and proactive SDET! :) 

### A quick overview!
This is a personal project created with the intention of implementing concepts that i'm currently studying, as a aspiring SDET with 4+ years of experience in Quality Assurance field! I hope you enjoy it as much as i enjoy the process of building this. :)

The project aims to demystify the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), by building an API from scratch. Through this, i aim to gain a deeper understanding of the software I'll test and automate in real-world workflows.
